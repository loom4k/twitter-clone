# Twitter Clone, Forever Shittier
### About

This as been created as a joke project for me to learn how to work with ElixirLang and Phoenix. It didn't come out as expected but I am still pretty happy with the result of this complete shit.

### Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
